# 🧠 Mastering Pydantic: A Developer's Guide to Clean Data in Python

Welcome to the **Pydantic Tutorial Repository** — your ultimate resource to understand and implement **robust data parsing and validation** in Python using the power of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/).

> 🚀 **Write less code, catch more bugs, build reliable data models — the Pydantic way.**

## 📁 Project Layout

All examples are inside the `/practice` directory — each script builds on the last to help you **learn progressively**.

## 📦 Installation Requirements

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed, and run:

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

Compatible with both **Pydantic v1 and v2** — examples will help you identify version-specific differences.
